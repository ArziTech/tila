# Development Dockerfile for TILA
# This Dockerfile is optimized for development with hot-reload and debugging

# Stage 1: Dependencies
FROM node:20-alpine AS deps
RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat

WORKDIR /app

# Install Bun as package manager
RUN npm install -g bun

# Copy package files
COPY package.json bun.lock* ./

# Install dependencies
RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile

# Stage 2: Builder
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat
WORKDIR /app

# Install Bun
RUN npm install -g bun

# Copy dependencies from deps stage
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .

# Generate Prisma Client
RUN bunx --bun prisma generate

# Build the application (for production, but we'll use dev mode)
# This also validates that the build works
RUN bun run build

# Stage 3: Development
FROM node:20-alpine AS development
RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat

WORKDIR /app

# Install Bun
RUN npm install -g bun

# Copy dependencies from deps stage
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules

# Copy built application (optional, for hybrid dev/prod mode)
# COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
# COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public

# Copy Prisma schema and generated client
COPY --from=builder /app/prisma ./prisma
COPY --from=builder /app/src/generated ./src/generated

# Copy source files for hot-reload
COPY . .

# Expose development port
EXPOSE 3000

# Set environment to development
ENV NODE_ENV=development
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1

# Start development server with hot-reload
# --turbo: Use Turbopack for faster builds (Next.js 13+)
# --hostname: Bind to all interfaces for Docker network access
